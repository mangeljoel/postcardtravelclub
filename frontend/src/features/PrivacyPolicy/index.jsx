                                We take customer satisfaction very seriously. If
                                You have a complaint in relation to Our handling
                                of Your Personal Information, We will endeavour
                                to handle it promptly and fairly. For Your
                                information, an overview of Our complaints
                                handling procedure is as follows:

                                Any complaints are forwarded to Our complaints
                                officer for review. We aim to review all
                                complaints within 7 days of receiving them
                                (although this cannot be guaranteed). If
                                necessary, the complaints officer may then refer
                                the complaint to another section within Our
                                organisation for consideration. If further
                                information is required, We may contact You to
                                request that information. If We accept fault in
                                relation to the complaint then We will propose a
                                resolution (which may or may not be the same as
                                any resolution proposed by You). If We do not
                                accept fault, then We will contact You to advise
                                You of this. We aim to complete this entire
                                process within 21 days, provided that We are
                                provided complete information in the first place
                                (although this cannot be guaranteed). However,
                                if You do not provide complete information then
                                this is likely to delay the handling of Your
                                complaint.
