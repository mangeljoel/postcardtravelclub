And being challenged when your natural tendency is towards gleeful anarchy, where there are no road maps, no instruction manuals and just passion is your guide. I came into the industry without a rule book, and I had no baggage from 'this is the way we do things'.</p>
<p>The travel ecosystem today, brims with an energy that is unparalleled. There are so many creative concepts and ideas to explore, and each one deserves its place in the sun.</p>
<p>Those of us who have built brands and successful businesses, have a responsibility — to share our learnings from experiences, nudge a little, ask questions and shake them out of their comfort zones — all of which goes a long way in helping build a future.</p></div>`,

        data: `<div><p>I travelled the length and breadth of the country opening stores for the lifestyle brand Fabindia and was always curious about the places I visited — the people and communities and what made them tick. I think I caught the travel bug.</p>
<p>What I built with Breakaway over the years is an outcome of my love for travel and curated experiences.I wanted to share my approach to travel with the world.</p>
    <p>There's so much India has to offer — the 'unknown in the known', that one needle-in-a-haystack experience that is an authentic way to experience the country, its culture and its people.</p>
<p>Personally, I have learned so much from travel — patience, persistence and how to be just more curious as I step out, sometimes into the known and also the unknown. 
Much of this has, of course, involved unravelling the social construct of my own upbringing - around how women must not travel alone, for starters.

        question: 'What are some of your favourite transformational travel experiences?',
        data: `<div><p>
There have been many: Learning to live outside one's comfort zone, pushing one's own boundaries when things don't go as planned, whether it's roadworks, bad weather, or a homestay owner having an emergency. Also, the realisation that once you're on the road, and in 'immersion mode', you must accept and surrender.</p>
<p>Travel does not become adventure until you leave yourself behind. - Marty Rubin. This quote, resonates.</p>
<p>Ladakh craft, textile, design immersions around the country, culinary experiences and Sustainable Journeys for Change (Give Change a Chance — location agnostic trailblazer and community-focused experiences) are some of my favourite transformational travel experiences.

<p>Someone who is willing to listen and trust. Someone who has come to us because they believe we can add value to their experience of a destination and the people they meet. And they can see this as a bond they forge with our country, one that goes beyond the trip they signed up for.
